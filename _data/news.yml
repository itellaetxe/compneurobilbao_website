  headline: 'Former Lab Member Marylin Gatica visits us!'
  description: "Today, we had a great talk with [Marylin Gatica](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QFTWPOgAAAAJ&hl=en) Postdoctoral Research 
  Assistant in the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University London. 
  Marylin shared her insights on Higher-order functional interactions in clinical applications. 
  Using human fMRI data, she explored how these interactions help us better understand and predict healthy aging, 
  neurodegenerative changes, and even how they might guide therapeutic neuromodulation. A fascinating dive into the future of neuroscience!"
